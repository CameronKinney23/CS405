This project submission includes a narrated MP4 video and supporting documentation from Project One in my Secure Software Development course. The video walks through 16 slides covering secure coding standard rankings, encryption and authentication policies, live SQL injection testing, the DevSecOps lifecycle, threat modeling, identified policy gaps, and future-facing recommendations. The presentation is grounded in industry frameworks like the OWASP Top 10, NISTâ€™s Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF), and the CWE/SANS Top 25, while emphasizing best practices such as early vulnerability mitigation, continuous integration of security, and strong access control policies. Supporting documentation includes a critical reflection on the adoption of secure coding standards, an evaluation of risk versus mitigation cost, analysis of zero trust principles, and actionable recommendations for operationalizing security policies within CI/CD workflows. Together, these materials reflect a security-first development culture and demonstrate a proactive approach to building resilient systems. APA-formatted citations are provided on the final slide and in the attached documentation.
